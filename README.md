# Knnclassification-on-cancer-dataset
The dataset present in sklearn library.converted the dataset into dataframe of applying the model the dataset was clean
# knn  classifier
1)K-Nearestneighbors algorithm is a non parametric and lazy learning algorithm - means there is no assumption for underlying data distribution

2)knn can used for both regression and classification ,generally used for classification

3)memory based algorithm ,the algorithm works by memorizing the labelled example they see in training data

# how does it works 
In knn "k" is called the number of nerarest neighbors,based on the number of neighbors close to a newdatapoint to the nerest traing instance the new datapoint will be classified as that class

1)claculate distance (with distance metric)

2)find the closest neighbors

3)vote for labels

# also used a method to find the best parameters for this model
explanation is given along with the code.Used the best hyperparameters to bulid the model
# Evaluvation
used classification report,AUC curve and also confusion matrix

# appied Minmax scaling
minmax scaling was applied to feature varible and it resulted an incerase in the accuracy
